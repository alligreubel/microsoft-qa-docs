# Hub Pages

1. These are pages that contain information about which products Q&A support. They can serve two purposes:
- Users can visit to see which products we support in Q&A.
- Teams can use these pages as landing pages from their sites, blog posts, etc.
2. As much as possible, we align with [Docs hub](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/) and [landing pages](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fwindows%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cv-trmyl%40microsoft.com%7C3c8c7dde5bde4cf4198a08d8246d0364%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637299397907868350&sdata=D2IdLbgwcOaC1jf6Q1HXEYGiCO2grR0jzqW7WAUS0ww%3D&reserved=0) in terms of grouping, products names, etc.
3. We only support two page types:
- The [Q&A home page](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fanswers%2Fproducts%2F&data=02%7C01%7Cv-trmyl%40microsoft.com%7C3c8c7dde5bde4cf4198a08d8246d0364%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637299397907868350&sdata=75T4%2FwdCbXCaCKKS3XOE9oFHTVtxZyP3LHEQrIkgHuM%3D&reserved=0).
    - This is where the main brands/products will list. If a product/service belongs to a brand, it will not appear here, but the brand will. For example, we are not adding Windows 10 in this page, instead, we are adding Windows and Windows 10 will be listed within the brand page.
    - Products in this page are sorted alphabetically.
- The brand page, i.e., [Azure](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fanswers%2Fproducts%2Fazure&data=02%7C01%7Cv-trmyl%40microsoft.com%7C3c8c7dde5bde4cf4198a08d8246d0364%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637299397907878303&sdata=GMBKHPtKDIAzzb3GNNHx6F5jyYwbMaZ%2FGj281FwILNk%3D&reserved=0), [Windows](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fanswers%2Fproducts%2Fwindows&data=02%7C01%7Cv-trmyl%40microsoft.com%7C3c8c7dde5bde4cf4198a08d8246d0364%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637299397907878303&sdata=uoTtFbcIm90mEf%2Babam40OexdESHIs0Fm%2F4MLxPdW4c%3D&reserved=0), etc. This is where we group and list the support offerings for that brand.
    - Partners propose the categories and groupings for your page.
4. Dev Rel is responsible to create the page with the information agreed upon with the partners. Partners will require sign off on the pages before going live.

> ## Common Q&A:
- Q: Can i have the Azure page look and feel?
- A: No, that page is reserved for Azure only at the moment. We are looking at how to expand the left nav to other brands and products, but we dont have a concrete date for when that will be available.
